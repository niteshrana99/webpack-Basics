We can also load css less and sass.
Webpack and CSS:
1. Bundle only the styles that app uses.
2. Import or require certain styles for certain files.
3. Transform SAAS or LESS to CSS.

For loading style we require to install 
for sass we need to install sass-loader node-sass

Similarly it can be done for LESS

LOADING IMAGES:
1. npm install url-loader file-loader:
Webpack inlines the url to the image bumdle and then returns this from require. Inlinig will ewduce the no. of http request and hence we can make our site fast.
